# emacs.d

My emacs.d config.

Trying to get a sane config for most of my (web) development work.

The setup is heavily inspired by (Purcell)[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d] for some of the Pythons setup I have followed a (Real Python Tutorial)[https://realpython.com/blog/python/emacs-the-best-python-editor/]
